/*
The isupper() function checks whether a character is an uppercase alphabet (A-Z) or not.
The islower() function checks whether a character is lowercase alphabet (az) or not.
Even though islower() takes integer as an argument, character is passed to the function. Internally, the character is converted to its ASCII value for the check.
Both isupper() and islower() are> by <ctype.h>
